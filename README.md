# SQL-Data-Base-NBA

This SQL project is designed to track basketball games in the American NBA league. Each table contains essential information about different components of the game. For example, the "Matches"("meciuri") table includes match ID, date, arena ID, team IDs, and scores. The score column is split into two columns (score 1 and score 2) to calculate specific indicators such as the average number of points scored by a team in each tournament match.
