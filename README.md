# SQL-Data-Base-for-NBA-games-management

This SQL project is designed to track basketball games in the American NBA league. Each table contains essential information about different components of the game. For example, the "Matches" table includes match ID, date, arena ID, team IDs, and scores. The score column is split into two columns (score 1 and score 2) to calculate specific indicators such as the average number of points scored by a team in each tournament match.

The "Continent" column in the "Country" table was removed because all countries/states belong to the USA, and the tournament is American-based. This project aims to efficiently organize and manage all matches for a smoother and more effective system.
